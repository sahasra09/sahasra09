 I do enjoy coding and 3d designing ( still getting better ) n have created over 100+ reps on various stuff involving python, c++ , sql, css and matlab 

I also did create a couple of games and websites ( go to repositories section beside overview on the top, pls dont fork any of them for your benefits )

 Some of my repositories require to be unzipped after being downloaded and can be run through VSC or npm install.


A couple of my python projects involving data visualisation hv been made on Google Colab :- ( a few of them using naive bayes, logistic regression ,confusion matrix n scattering [and some more supervised ML ] ) :-

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-xZPqX2OEUJVIaGlSVDibvriLicd9fwz?usp=sharing ( a basic confusion matrix )

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zDtWZA7UPFClugnxxgIQYBR-ore9Nek6?usp=sharing ( digit recognition using logistic regression )

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Hjd4Ka1PK_lv7E0Mhh34qwgRO3oL_FSh?usp=sharing ( clusters of interstellar objects like stars plotted using KMeans )

.. and allot more google colab projects 

I also have made very few projs of matlab on Octave.

To access my other projects, you can message me.
PS:- I dont code anymore.
