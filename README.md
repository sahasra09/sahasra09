I uhm like wasting time ‚≠ê

athlete:- i play badminton professionally and skate some times 

 I do enjoy coding and 3d designing ( still getting better ) n have created over 100+ reps on various stuff involving python, ml, c++ , sql, css and matlab 

I also did create a couple of games and websites ( go to repositories section beside overview on the top, pls dont fork any of them for your benefits )

 Some of my repositories require to be unzipped after being downloaded and can be run through VSC
